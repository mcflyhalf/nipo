#Create Various necessary Tables to be used as tables in the DB. Classes represent tables in the DB and objects will represent rows in these tables. This is how Sqlalchemy and other Python ORM's work

#Create Module class (corresponds to DB table that has a list of modules. We expect that each module will in turn have qualities like start date, end date, class days (are its classes on a Mon, Tue, Wed etc), start time(s), end time(s)(in case of multiple occurences of a module in a week, venue(s), start date, end date(s) and the class that should attend this lesson etc)
